Welcome to scoresball!
Made by the Daniel's.

We have a home page that includes the main leagues in the world,from there you can navigate to every league's page.

In every league page there is an updated table, short description and current news.

We used a lot of new featues including: using Github for version control,Iframe,collapsing compatibility,shadow,navbar and cards using bootstrap,special font,and a gradient for the navbar.
We also use bootstrap to align items horizontally, javascript to make the navbar collapsable.
