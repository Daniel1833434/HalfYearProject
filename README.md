The site is about the main football leagues in the world!

We have a home page that includes the main leagues in the world,from there you can navigate to every league's page.

In every league page there is an updated table, short description and current news.

We used a lot of new featues including: using Github for version control,Iframe,collapsing compatibility,shadow,navbar and cards using bootstrap,special font,and a gradient for the navbar.
We also use bootstrap to align items horizontally, javascript to make the navbar collapsable.

We used, ChatGPT,Github Copilot,w3 schools and Bootstrap Docs which helped us with a lot of information on how to do certian things
like: Navbar,Collapsing,Font,Iframe,shadow,gradient background color,Cards,Align items horizontally and a collapsable navbar.
It also helped us to understand what we were doing and why.
