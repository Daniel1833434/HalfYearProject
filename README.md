Welcome to scoresball!
Made by the Daniel's.

We have a home page that includes the main leagues in the world,from there you can navigate to the every league's page.

In every league page there is a updated table, short description and current news.

We used a lot of new featues including: using Github for version control,Iframe,collapsing compatibility,shadow,navbar and cards using bootstrap,special font,and a gradient for the navbar.
We also use bootstrap to align the items of each league and javascript to make the navbar collapsable.
